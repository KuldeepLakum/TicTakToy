Players alternate turns placing their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. Once a box is clicked, itâ€™s disabled, ensuring fair play.

The game automatically checks for a winner after every turn, using predefined patterns to detect three matching symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

If all squares are filled and no winner is detected, the game concludes with a draw.

A responsive message box provides live updates, announcing the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

Players can reset the grid mid-game or start a new round after a match. Both actions clear the grid and reset the turn to Player O.
